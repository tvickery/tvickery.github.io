I am a cognitive neuroscientist and Associate Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of Delaware. I lead the [Perception and Learning Lab](cogneurolab.org). I study a broad range of phenomena but my current interests are in human visual perception of groups and objects, learning and memory, and attention / working memory.
